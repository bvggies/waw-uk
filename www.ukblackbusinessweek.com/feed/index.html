		<p class="p1">Just a few tips we&#8217;ve picked up over the years from sessions we&#8217;ve hosted&#8230;These strategies are like magical potions that can turn prospects into loyal customers faster than you can say &#8220;abracadabra.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>PERSONALISATION <span class="s1"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
</span></strong>Forget the generic sales pitch—it&#8217;s time to get personal! Customers these days crave customised experiences. Treat each customer like a unique individual by tailoring your approach. Use their preferences, interests, and purchase history to dish out personalised recommendations, exclusive offers, and spot-on content. When they realise you &#8220;get&#8221; them, they&#8217;ll be hooked!</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>ACTIVE LISTENING <span class="s1"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f3a7.png" alt="🎧" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
</span></strong>Picture this: you&#8217;re having a conversation with a friend over a cup of coffee. That&#8217;s the vibe you want when engaging with potential customers. Be an expert listener! Ask open-ended questions, encourage them to share their thoughts, and really soak in what they have to say. Oh, and don&#8217;t forget to address their needs—it&#8217;s like adding a cherry on top!</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>NOT JUST ANY FOLLOW-UP <span class="s1"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f4e7.png" alt="📧" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
</span></strong>Stay on top of your follow-up game like a true sales superstar. Respond promptly, provide the info they need, and keep the excitement alive. And hey, it doesn&#8217;t end there! Keep nurturing those relationships even after the sale. Surprise them with awesome resources, exclusive deals, or a friendly check-in. Befriend them on LinkedIn &amp; regularly interact with their posts to establish yourself in their network!</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>HONE YOUR SKILLSET <span class="s1"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f3af.png" alt="🎯" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
</span></strong>Use industry events like UK Black Business Week to hone your skills, whether marketing, sales or entrepreneurial, these events are your opportunity to learn from success stories, be inspired and meet incredibly valuable connections.</p>

		<p><strong>What was your 1st job; did it have any impact on your career?</strong></p>
	</div>
</div>



<blockquote class="nectar_single_testimonial" tabindex="0" data-color="accent-color" data-style="small_modern"><div class="inner"> <p><span class="open-quote">&#8221;</span>My work experience began with odd summer jobs as a teenager which ranged from tutoring 11+ to working in catering at Tottenham football club and Ascot. Great lessons here related to client engagement and customer service as well as having difficult conversations.<br />
At university, I took a trial and error approach to deciding what I wanted to do. I began interning at a range of financial services firms in order to find what would suit me best. My last internship in my first year of university was in Consulting and I immediately loved working in a team, the client interaction and the variety of the role.<br />
Little did I know I would spend 5 years in consulting, learning all about business transformation across financial services working with leading banks, insurers and asset managers, not just in London but also travelling and working in Germany and South Africa. Throughout these client projects, one thing was clear to me. Digital disruption was coming!<br />
From rolling out new tech such as robotic process automation (RPA) - the use of software robots to automate manual processes in banks to recognising the awful customer experience with online banking wouldn’t work for millennials and Gen Z, it was apparent everywhere. And this is what eventually led me to where I am now, fintech! </p></div></blockquote>

		<p><strong>What barriers to entry did you encounter early on in your career? How did you overcome?</strong></p>
	</div>
</div>



<blockquote class="nectar_single_testimonial" tabindex="0" data-color="accent-color" data-style="small_modern"><div class="inner"> <p><span class="open-quote">&#8221;</span>Believe it or not, I think my biggest barrier was self-confidence. Working in a large competitive organisation where everyone is intelligent and doing interesting work was tough. You can’t help but compare yourself to others. For instance, coming pretty much straight from university I was one of the youngest in my graduate intake and the only black female graduate in consulting out of over 100 graduates. Intimidating!</p>
<p>My top tips are to embrace standing out and aim to stand out for the right reasons, ie. the one who always asks great questions or who is always taking detailed notes or who is a pro at excel. Your first few jobs are just about being a sponge and absorbing as much as possible and learning what you do and don’t like doing. Finally, I learnt to work hard loudly. Not being afraid to document and vocalise my achievements on a regular basis. </p></div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="nectar_single_testimonial" tabindex="0" data-color="accent-color" data-style="small_modern"><div class="inner"> <p><span class="open-quote">&#8221;</span>Whilst at university, I founded the University of Birmingham Women in Finance Society at the end of my first year to demystify the male-dominated industry of financial services and expose young women to top financial services firms. This society was probably the highlight of my university experience.<br />
As the founder and Chair of the Women in Finance Society, I led our steering committee chairing and organising numerous team meetings and accumulating several thousand pounds in sponsorship. When I left university, we were hosting over a dozen events a year, had more than 200 members, a steady social media following and an annual society conference focused on getting female students and young women at local Birmingham secondary schools ready for the Working World, the Working World Ready Conference. I know the society is still up and running today which fills me with great pride!<br />
Post leaving university, I came to experience for myself what it is like to work in a male-dominated industry and it was tough. I quickly set-up the Now You're Talking Network. Which is now a 5-year-old female community and business supporting women to earn more and be more confident. We host our own events and workshops as well as run corporate workshops for a range of leading companies and startups relating to career and personal development. We also have active communication groups, social media and a fortnightly newsletter. And we are an official media partner of the UK Black Business Week so you might see a few of our team and members around in October! </p></div></blockquote>

I went on to have another full-time content marketing job, but as Jamii grew, there was scope for me to take on a more operational role on the side. By the time I joined full-time in 2019, it was a natural transition because being the designated copy and content writer since the start of the business meant that I knew the brand more than anyone else did. </p></div></blockquote>

I ended working in a call centre until I stumbled upon the Evening Standard Jobs page with an advert for Customer Service Representative at Midland Bank.

</div>



<blockquote class="nectar_single_testimonial" tabindex="0" data-color="accent-color" data-style="small_modern"><div class="inner"> <p><span class="open-quote">&#8221;</span>That's a complicated question to answer as I certainly didn't start my career as an investor and I took a fairly long and winding road.</p>
<p>In fact, I started out as a software developer. I studied Computer Science at the University of Kent and landed myself an industrial placement at Lehman Brothers (the investment bank). From there I returned as a graduate after taking some time out to travel and spent the next 10 years in Investment Banking technology. Five of those years were with Credit Suisse in Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
<p>Next, I became a fintech entrepreneur and co-founded a startup called Neyber where I was the founding CTO. After leaving Neyber I joined Impact X Capital as a founding member, principal investor and CTO. </p></div></blockquote>

		<p><strong>Can you tell us about your early academic life?</strong></p>
	</div>
</div>



<blockquote class="nectar_single_testimonial" tabindex="0" data-color="accent-color" data-style="small_modern"><div class="inner"> <p><span class="open-quote">&#8221;</span>Well, I went to a terrible state comprehensive secondary school where the 5 A-C GCSE pass rate was only 14% so my peer group at the time really didn't appreciate education and frankly I was more interested in video games and martial arts. But this lack of academic focus led to me underperforming at GCSE and ultimately failing my A-Levels. However, this was the kick-start that I needed, as it forced me to confront my attitude to studying (or lack thereof) and really apply myself. I realised after a conversation with my dad that my future was in my hands and my hands alone.</p>
<p>Because of that sea change in attitude, I knuckled down re-sat my A-levels and chose to attend the University of Kent specifically because it had an industrial placement year. I knew even then that my educational track record would become a hindrance if I didn't find a way to negate it. This then led to me doing a year-long work placement at Lehman Brothers and ultimately put me on the path that I am on today. </p></div></blockquote>

		<p><strong>Looking back on those early days, what advice would you give an 18 year old &#8230;?<br />
</strong></p>

<blockquote class="nectar_single_testimonial" tabindex="0" data-color="accent-color" data-style="small_modern"><div class="inner"> <p><span class="open-quote">&#8221;</span>Study! Life would have been a lot easier if I had simply revised for my exams! But seriously I think I would give the same advice that I give everyone who is at the start of their career. Focus on building a great professional network and a deep technical skill set. The network will create unforeseen opportunities for you whilst the technical skill set will give you the ability to take advantage of those opportunities when they eventually arise. </p></div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="nectar_single_testimonial" tabindex="0" data-color="accent-color" data-style="small_modern"><div class="inner"> <p><span class="open-quote">&#8221;</span>If I look at the work that I do with Impact X Capital and Code Untapped, the mentoring I provide to Amos Bursary, Foundervine, and MSDUK, the advice I provide to organisations such as Crisis and Spring and even the honours I have received, I like to think that everything I do has some kind of positive impact on the next generation. I hope that those kids out there who, like me, maybe haven't had the best start in life can look to me and everything that I have done and achieved and realise that it's possible for them to do the same. </p></div></blockquote><div class="divider-wrap" data-alignment="default"><div style="margin-top: 10px; height: 1px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-width="100%" data-animate="yes" data-animation-delay="" data-color="default" class="divider-border"></div></div>
